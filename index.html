            I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior knowledge
            in software development. However, within a few weeks, I was able to
            grasp the crux of software development and also master the soft
            skills required for being a software developer. 
          </p>
          <p>So far so good, the
            skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing push in my career as a
            software developer.</p>

            Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get in
            the real world space. I had an immense learning that was really
            different from the self learning I started with. The learning was
            fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were
            presented to us. I got my first gig immediately after the program.
            
          </p>
          <p>Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed.</p>

          waiting for.
